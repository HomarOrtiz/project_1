Olympic Medal Data (post WWII)

Purpose
  - The intent of this code was to summarize the performances of countries in the olypmpics after the second great war and find any specific patterns.  Data from the summer and winterolympics     was used in conjuction with current country GDP per Capita and population

Challenges
  - A major issue that ws found within our group was the countries listed had codes isnstead of names.  A for loop was created by Traci ELlis to find the names of the countries from the IOC (international olympic committee) 3-letter codes
  - Due to the nature of the Cold War folowing the great war, many countires have been reshaped and/or disbanded since the dissolution ot the USSR in the early 90's
  - This reflects largley in our visualizations

Key Findings
  - The United States was largely the most dominant country in the summer games and to a slightly lesser degree for winter games
  - The USSR reached an apex of olympic performnace in 1980
  - GDP has no effect on medal totals

Conclusion
- The War appears to have had a profound effect on the perfomrnace of countries during the olympics. The 2 superpowers (USA and USSR) political and idealogical rivalry seems to have spilled over into olympic competition
- A further comparison against pre-WWII medal totals could shed greater light on the effect that the war has on country performance
