Olympic Medal Data (Post WWII)

Purpose
  - The intent of this analysis was to summarize the performances of countries in the Olypmpic Games after World War II and find any specific patterns. Data with the results from the Summer and Winter Olympic Games was used in conjuction with current country GDP per Capita and population count to answer the questions that our group posed. 

Challenges
  - A major issue that was found within our group was that we stumbled across country codes in the Summer and Winter Olympic Games CSV's that were not represented in the Dictionary CSV. Traci Ellis took it upon herself to find the names of the countries from the International Olympic Committee 3-letter codes, and created a For Loop in Visual Studio Code to add a column with the corresponding country names.
  - Due to the nature of the Cold War folowing World War II, many countries have been reshaped and/or disbanded since the dissolution ot the USSR in the early 90's. This reflects largely in our visualizations.

Key Findings
  - The United States was largely the most dominant country in the summer games and to a slightly lesser degree for winter games.
  - The USSR reached an apex of olympic performance in 1980, largely outperforming the USA.
  - GDP had no effect on the total count of medals awarded to individual athletes. 
  - There was correlation found between the top three performers of the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in both 1948, and 1980. However, the top three finishers of 2010 Winter Olympic Games were completely different than the 2012 Summer Olympic Games  .

  *Note*
  The Summer Olympic Games and the Winter Olympic Games were held during the same year up until the year 1994, where they started overlapping the competitions every two years. 

Conclusion
- The Second World War appears to have had a profound effect on the performance of countries during the Olympics. The two superpowers (USA and USSR) political and idealogical rivalry seems to have spilled over into olympic competition.
- A further comparison against pre-WWII medal totals could shed greater light on the effect that the war has on country performance.
